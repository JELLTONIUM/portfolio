                    <p>8/30/2018 - 9/7/2018<br></p>
                    <p>Some of my very first games were made with scratch.
                    I worked with a partner to create a platformer where the objective was
                    to get from the start to a green flag, it was a very simple game where
                    the grounds and platforms are just a plain brown block.<br>The way it 
                    would work is that there would always be some gravity moving the sprite
                    down, then when space is pressed, there is a quick burst of speed upwards
                    that creates a jumping motion and then lets the gravity pull it back to 
                    the surface. Then the sprite started falling indefinitely, so we made
                    a force that counters the gravity whenever the sprite touches a platform
                    and to prevent the sprite from going airborn when space is repeatedly
                    pressed, the jumping would only work if the sprite was touching the 
                    ground and space was pressed.
