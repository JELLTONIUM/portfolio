                    <h2>Scratch Project</h2>
                    <p>8/30/2018 - 9/7/2018<br></p>
                    <p>Some of my very first games were made with scratch.
                    I worked with a partner to create a platformer where the objective was
                    to get from the start to a green flag, it was a very simple game where
                    the grounds and platforms are just a plain brown block.<br>The way it 
                    would work is that there would always be some gravity moving the sprite
                    down, then when space is pressed, there is a quick burst of speed upwards
                    that creates a jumping motion and then lets the gravity pull it back to 
                    the surface. Then the sprite started falling indefinitely, so we made
                    a force that counters the gravity whenever the sprite touches a platform
                    and to prevent the sprite from going airborn when space is repeatedly
                    pressed, the jumping would only work if the sprite was touching the 
                    ground and space was pressed.

                    <h2>Image Artist Project</h2>
                    <p>2/25/19 - 3/28/2019<br></p>
                    <p>In this project, we were tasked to create any type of photoshop
                    function using python with a partner. My partner was Anurag
                    and our first idea was just to add a border because it was in 
                    instructions. After we got it working, we didn't know what else
                    to do but we wanted to do something out of the ordinary. So the
                    final plan was to write code that could mark out the edges of 
                    objects. The first set of code we wrote adds up the first 3 
                    values, then compares it with the pixles around it because 
                    usually, the item would be colored differently than its's 
                    background. This worked well but for some darker or brighter
                    images, the differences in color are very small so a set number
                    that is used to compare all the pixals is inefficent. We then
                    added a function that would find the average color of the 
                    image that it then will use to compare, this worked much better
                    than the ove before.
