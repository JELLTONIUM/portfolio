            <p class="col-sm-6">I am a student and I want to be a programmer.
            I have a family of 5 people. I love programming and making things, 
            I've created a marionette thats controlled from a box with buttons 
            out of cardboard. I can also play the violin and compose some music,
            I have learned the violin for 7 years. I like to play survival, 
            co-op, and openworld games.<br>I used to create board games out of 
            cardboard by thinking of an idea, creating the rules, designing the 
            pieces, cutting them out, then finalizing. All of my games are played
            with 2 or more people and I would just play with my family. Since 
            every piece was moved by hand, they would all have to be turn-based 
            games to prevent any cheating or dissagreement.
