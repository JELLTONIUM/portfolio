            <p class="col-sm-6">Hello, I am Michael and I am a student, I want to
            be a programmer or some job in the gaming industry and want to just 
            create games with a group of people. I plan to take computer science
            and game design through high school and hopefully college. I want to
            take this path because I love programming.<br><br>
            I enjoy using technology, I like typing on a keyboard and I can code.
            I can use html, CSS, Command line, and Python. I also play games, I 
            have created some games using Scratch and MIT App Inventor. I am good
            at finding bugs and broken aspects of a game. I have sent countless 
            bug reports to game companies. I can learn really fast If I am 
            interested in something, I can understand how something works, or 
            how something doesn't work.<br><br>
            I also can build things, for example, I have built a working umbrella 
            for fun and customised pens to be mechanical pencils. Once, I
            modified a multicolored pen to not only be a mechanical pencil, but
            to be a marker and a color pencil at the same time. I can also play 
            the violin, I can write some music from scratch and sight read.<br><br>
            In the end, I like games and want to create them. I know how to code
            and will learn more. Thank you!

            <!--I am a student and I want to be a programmer.
            I have a family of 5 people. I love programming and making things, 
            I've created a marionette thats controlled from a box with buttons 
            out of cardboard. I can also play the violin and compose some music,
            I have learned the violin for 7 years. I like to play survival, 
            co-op, and openworld games.<br>I used to create board games out of 
            cardboard by thinking of an idea, creating the rules, designing the 
            pieces, cutting them out, then finalizing. All of my games are played
            with 2 or more people and I would just play with my family. Since 
            every piece was moved by hand, they would all have to be turn-based 
            games to prevent any cheating or disagreement.-->
