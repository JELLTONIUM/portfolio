            <p class="">Hello, I am Michael and I am a student, I want to
            be a programmer or some job in the gaming industry and want to just 
            create games with a group of people. I plan to take computer science
            and game design through high school and hopefully college. I want to
            take this path because I love programming.<br><br>
            I enjoy using technology, I like typing on a keyboard and I can code.
            I can use html, CSS, Command line, and Python. I also play games, I 
            have created some games using Scratch and MIT App Inventor. I am good
            at finding bugs and broken aspects of a game. I have sent countless 
            bug reports to game companies. I can learn really fast If I am 
            interested in something, I can understand how something works, or 
            how something doesn't work.<br><br>
            I also can build things, for example, I have built a working umbrella 
            for fun and customised pens to be mechanical pencils. I've
            modified a multicolored pen to not only be a mechanical pencil, but
            to be a marker and a color pencil at the same time. I can also play 
            the violin, I can write some music from scratch and sight read.<br><br>
            In the end, I like games and want to create them. I know how to code
            and will learn more. Thank you!
            </p>
